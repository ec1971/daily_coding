# notes
## difference between expression and statement
- an expression evaluates to an value
- a statement does things 
 
## applicative order vs normal order
- applicative order
- normal order
    - fully expand and then reduce

## fixed-point function
- the key is to formulate a computation as a fixed-point search
- e.g. square root computation requires finding y such that x^2 = a
- the f in question becomes lambda (x) (/ a x)
