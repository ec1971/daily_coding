## reading notes
### notes
- I/O redirection
    ```sh
    ls existing-file non-existing-file > temp1 2>&1
    ```
    - make sure you understand what the above command means


### questions/unresolved issues
- given that shell is just a UI for system calls, how does it execute the commands behind the scene?
- why not combine fork and exec in a single call?
    - because we might need to perform additional tasks(e.g. redirect i/o) after fork?
